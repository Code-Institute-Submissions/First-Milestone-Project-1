                <p class="band-description">The Monkees debuted on television in September 1966, and <strong>Davy Jones</strong> attracted a lot of attention from fans for his
                charm, wit, warm sense of humor and boyish good looks. The Monkees soon scored on the music charts with hits like "I'm
                a Believer," "Pleasant Valley Sunday" and "Daydream Believer"—covers of songs originally released by Neil Diamond,
                Gerry Goffin and Carole King, and John Stewart, respectively—and their albums sold millions of copies. Jones later
                wrote several autobiographies, including 1987's They Made a Monkee Out of Me.</p>

                <p class="band-description"><strong>Micky Dolenz</strong> was born on March 8, 1945 in Los Angeles. He had a few television roles and played with bands before being
                cast in The Monkees, a show about a fictitious rock band. Though made for TV, The Monkees had real-life hits and
                struggled against their "Pre-Fab Four" image. The series was canceled in 1968 and the band split in 1969. Dolenz has
                appeared on Broadway and worked as a tv director.</p>

                <p class="band-description">Born in Texas in 1942, <strong>Michael Nesmith</strong> served in the U.S. Air Force before pursuing a career in music. He signed on to become a
                member of the Monkees, a television rock group, in the mid-1960s. The Monkees enjoyed tremendous success on the pop
                charts. After he left the group in 1970s, Nesmith pursued solo projects. He has occasionally reunited with his Monkees
                bandmates over the years.</p>

                <p class="band-description">Born in 1942, <strong>Peter Tork</strong> discovered a passion for music early on. He participated in the New York City folk scene in
                the early 1960s. Moving to California, he landed a part in The Monkees television series in 1965. The fictional band
                soon became a real hit, scoring several No. 1 songs. Tork left the group in the late 1960s, but he has reunited with
                the Monkees several times over the years.</p>

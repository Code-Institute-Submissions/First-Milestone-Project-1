##### First Milestone Project
## The Monkees' website 

The band is a 1960's rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world.

### UX
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

Users Stories:

- As a son of Monkees' fan, I want to see and hear their clips, to check if they are really amazing.
